# NSU BOOK ROOM
This project's primary goal is to help new Writers. It is a social media where a writer can write short stories, long stories, and blogs. Also, users can comment on a particular post. 
Criticize any topic; there is a dedicated section called blogging. 
Any users can share their thoughts and idea to discuss any of them. 

Each User will have a personal profile where they can view their personal information and edit it. This section also shows their writing ratings and their bookmarks. 

Users can send friend requests to others. There will be a separate chat box for contact between familiar friends.
